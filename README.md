# Zara Sales Analysis

This project analyzes Zara sales patterns to determine if item promotions and product location influence sales volume.

## Tools Used
  - MySQL
  - Python
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - NumPy
  - Jupyter Notebook
## Questions Explored
  - Which type of products generate the most revenue?
  - Do products on promotion sell more than non-promoted products?
  - Does product position influence sales, and does product promotion amplify this?
## Summary
  Jackets generated more than half of Zara's revenue. Products on promotion sold slightly more average volume than non-promoted items(~7 units difference). Products located at the front of the store sold the most volume. Only promoted items on an end-cap saw an increase in sales volume.
